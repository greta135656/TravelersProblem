# TravelersProblem
- Period 4, Group 2
- Group members: Emma Chio, Grace Chen, Greta Yang, Emmy Chen, Elizabeth Stansberry, Edward Oo
- We were discussing whether or not we should use Random and how we should use it. We decided to use a 2d array and generate random route possibilities.
- Made the repo, invited group members, scheduled a meeting.
- We had a meeting at 9 pm on Jan 19 and all of us joined the call. First we went over what we have discussed in class, then we spent over 2 hours coding together on Codeshare. (we tried to use Google Docs first but it didn't work well)
- We made 2 functions.
